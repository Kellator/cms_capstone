### Summary:  
>ALCIS was designed as a simple, low cost, easily maintainable and customizable client management system for a non-profit assisted living community.  ALCIS is an easy to use database for client information including admissions, medical, and financial data.  The purpose of the database is to streamline the admissions data collection process, improve communication between the multiple departments involved in admissions and screening, and to improve the admissions and screening process for both clients and employees.
Users are able to add prospective client data including contact information, basic demographic information, financial information, physical care needs, and housing preferences.  Users are also able to edit that information and remove clients from the database as needed.  

### Technology:
>ALCIS was developed using the Node.js platform with Express.js framework along with Passport.js authentication middleware and Bcrypt password hashing function for security.  The database is built using MongoDB and Mongoose.js.  Languages used are HTML, CSS, Javascript as well as the jQuery library.  ALCIS is a single-page application built to run on desktop devices.
